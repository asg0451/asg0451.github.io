SketchOff was a group project developed as part of our Software Engineering class at CWRU. It is a real-time multiplayer drawing game where a judge picks a phrase for users to draw, users draw their interpretation of the phrase, and the judge picks the best submission.

The site is available at **[sketchoff.xyz](http://sketchoff.xyz)**.


Video demonstration coming soon!
